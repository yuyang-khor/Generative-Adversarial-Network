# Generative-Adversarial-Network
Deep Learning project on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), consists process of building both Generator and Discriminator

GAN is a machine learning (ML) model in which two neural networks compete with each other by using deep learning methods to become more accurate in their predictions. The goal of the Generator is to artificially manufacture outputs that could easily be mistaken for real data. The goal of the Discriminator is to identify which of the outputs it receives have been artificially created.
